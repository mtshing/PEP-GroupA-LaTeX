In electromagnetism, 
theoretically every problem can be solved through a set of PDEs
called the \bf{Maxwell Equations}.\\[-2em]

However, a \it{system of PDEs} is too complicated to be solved.
So we need to learn different "tricks" to avoid them,
which are enough for some simple scenarios.\\

Electrostatics only concerns the \nth{3} equation of the set - \cul[blue]{Faraday's law}.

\section{A Brief History of Electromagnetism}

Electromagnetic induction is likely the most confusing topic in beginner E\&M.
In my opinion, taking reference of the history is helpful to unify the concepts you have learnt.

\section{Motion under Lorentz Force}

Nowadays we know that Lorentz force is the fundamental explanation to magnetic induction.
But interestingly, it was formulated correctly only in the very late history of classical E\&M.
\aleq{
    \Aboxed{
        m\vvec{a} = \vvec{F}_E + \vvec{F}_B = q\vvec{E} + q\vvec{v}\cross\vvec{B}
    }
}

In general, $\vvec{E}$ and $\vvec{B}$ may be functions of time and position. 
For simplicity, we will only discuss \cul[red]{the special case when the fields are constant}.
By symmetry, we can assume that $\vvec{B}$ is only in $\hhat{z}$ direction, 
i.e. $\vvec{B} = B_z\hhat{z}$.
Then the Newton's \nth{2} law then writes as
\aleq{
    m\dvv{t}\bmat{v_x\\v_y\\v_z} = q\bmat{E_x\\E_y\\E_z} 
        + q\bdet{\hhat{x} & \hhat{y} & \hhat{z}\\ v_x & v_y & v_z \\ 0 & 0 & B_z}
}

which turns into a system of 3 \nth{1} order linear ODEs.
\aleq{
    \bcase{
        m\dvv{v_x}{t} &= qE_x + qv_yB_z\\
        m\dvv{v_y}{t} &= qE_y - qv_xB_z\\
        m\dvv{v_z}{t} &= qE_z
    }
}

This system is simple enough that we do not need to use any matrix methods.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \bf{\ul{z component}}\\
    Motion in $z$ direction is independent of $x$/$y$.
    Can be solved alone.
    \aleq{
        m\dvv{v_z}{t} = qE_z 
        \qquad\Rightarrow\qquad
        &v_z(t) = \frac{qE_z}{m}t + v_{z0}\\[1ex]
        &z(t) = \half\frac{qE_z}{m}t^2 
            + \tkn{init_vz}{\cul[blue]{v_{z0}}}t + \tkn{init_z}{\cul[blue]{z_0}}
    }

    \addArrow[blue]{init_z}{(0,-4ex)}{\scriptsize Initial\\[-1ex]\scriptsize z coordinate}{(0,-1ex)}{(3ex,0.5ex)}
    
    which is just a constant acceleration motion.

    \item \bf{\ul{x/y components}}\\
    They can be solved by differentiating one of them,
    then substitute into the other.
    \aleq{
        \dvv[2]{v_x}{t} &= \frac{qB_z}{m}\dvv{v_y}{t} \\[1ex]
        &= \frac{qB_z}{m}\qty(\frac{qE_y}{m}-\frac{qB_z}{m}v_x)\\[1ex]
        &= - \frac{q^2B_z^2}{m}\qty(v_x - \frac{E_y}{B_z})
    }

    which is once again the familiar ODE of SHM.
    \aleq{
        v_x(t) &= -C' \sin\qty(\frac{qB_z}{m}t + \phi) + \frac{E_y}{B_z}\\[1ex]
        \Rightarrow\quad x(t) &= \cus[red]{C'\qty(\frac{m}{qB_z})}{\text{constant}}\cos \qty(\frac{qB_z}{m}t + \phi) 
            + \frac{E_y}{B_z}t + x_0\\[1ex]
        &= \tkn{init_r}{\cul[blue]{C}} \cos \qty(\frac{qB_z}{m}t + \tkn{phase}{\cul[blue]{\phi}}) 
            + \frac{E_y}{B_z}t + \tkn{init_x}{\cul[blue]{x_0}}

    \vskip 1em
    And subsitute back to equation of $v_y$ gives
    \aleq{
        v_y(t) &= \frac{m}{qB_z}\dvv{v_x}{t} - \frac{E_x}{B_z} \\[1ex]

    The result $x$-$y$ motion is a combination of circular motion + drifting.

    }

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Note that the drifting direction is not intuitive: 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item With $E_x$ only, drifting direction = $-\hhat{y}$
            \item With $E_y$ only, drifting direction = $\hhat{x}$
        \end{itemize}
        In general, the drifting direction is along direction of $\vvec{E}\cross\vvec{B}$ 
        with a speed $\dfrac{\norm{\vvec{E}}}{\norm{\vvec{B}}}$

            \text{Radius}=R \qquad\Rightarrow\qquad \text{Speed}=\frac{qB_z}{m}R
        }
        i.e. Angular velocity is fixed at $\omega = \dfrac{qB_z}{m}$,
        independent of the charge's initial velocity.\\

\section{Magnetic Induction}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{EMF - Force or Voltage?}

The term \bf{electromotive force} (EMF) was invented by Alessandro Volta in 1801,
for explaining observations in electrochemistry.\\

Metal electrodes in electrolyte 
\begin{itemize}
    \item[$\Rightarrow$] Current generates spontaneously.
    \item[$\Rightarrow$] There must be some kind of "force" pushing the current! 
\end{itemize}

\insertFig{electrolyte}

In early 1800s, scientists tended to describe things like mechanical system,
i.e. any motions of objects must be driven by some kind of "force".
So when there is a steady current, 
there must be a "force" that keep pushing the charges forward.
namely the "electromotive force". 

\begin{itemize}
    \item However, EMF took the unit of volt because 
    voltage measurement was the only way to quantify the magnitude of EMF.
    \item Later when Michael Faraday discovered the phenomena of magnetic induction,
    he used the same word to refer to the source of the induced current.
\end{itemize}


Today we still keep the name as a "force", 
even though we already know much better how current is generated in different sources.
Maybe because people are already used to refer the same term \red{"EMF" 
as the general name for ANY kind of current source}, 
rather than discriminating them by their origin of energy.

\insertFig{i dun care}

Below we only focus on the two kinds of EMF that relate to magnetic induction phenomena.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \bf{\ul{Motional EMF}} : Source of energy = Motion of the charges' "container".
    Can be explained via Lorentz force.

    \item \bf{\ul{Transformer EMF}} : Source of energy = Change in magnetic field.
    Explanation requires relativity.
\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Motional EMF}

Under Lorentz force, 
free charges move in circles in a constant B-field.
But if the charges' movements are restricted, 
charge distribution becomes uneven by building up potential difference. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{A Moving Battery}

If there is only one charge in the middle of a rod, 
the charge is free to move in a circlar trajectory.
(And the rod will be dragged along by the charge. 
Even if the rod is restricted to move horizonally,
it simply undergoes SHM.)

\insertFig{pipe SHM}

On the other hand, for charges that are at the ends of the rod,
they will be pushed against at the end walls and can no longer move.

\insertFig{pipe potential}

This results in a charge accumulation at the end of the rod, 
building up a potential difference, 
and storing energy that \cul[red]{can be released once the rod stop moving.}

\begin{center}
    \red{The pipe can be used to drive current when it is kept moving - It is a moving battery!}
\end{center}


We can calculate the the potential built up in the rod
by looking into the energy conservation process.
\begin{enumerate}

    \item Suppose the B-field is constant and is in $\hhat{z}$ direction, i.e. $\vvec{B}=B_z\hhat{z}$.
    While the work done on a charge by Lorentz force of B-field is $0$ 
    (because $\vvec{F}_B$ always perpendicular to $\vvec{v} =\dv{\vvec{r}}{t} \sim \dd{\vvec{r}}$),
    we can split it into the work done in two directions:
    \aleq{
        \text{W.D.} &= \vvec{F}_B \cdot \dd{\vvec{r}} = 0 \\[1ex]
        &= q(\vvec{v}\cross\vvec{B})\cdot\dd{\vvec{r}} \\[1ex]
        &= q\qty[(\vvec{v}_x+\vvec{v}_y)\cross \vvec{B}]\cdot \qty(\dd{\vvec{x}}+\dd{\vvec{y}})\\
        %
        %&= q\qty(-v_xB_z\hhat{y} + v_yB_z\hhat{x})\cdot \qty(\dd{\vvec{x}}+\dd{\vvec{y}})\\
        &= \cus[blue]{\ccancelto[blue]{0}{q(\vvec{v}_x\cross\vvec{B})\cdot\dd{\vvec{x}}}}
            {\substack{\vvec{v}_x\cross \vvec{B}= v_xB_z(\hhat{x}\cross \hhat{z})
                \\\phantom{\vvec{v}_{xi} \vvec{B}}=v_xB_z(-\hhat{y})\\[0.5ex]
                \text{Dotting with }\hhat{x}\text{ gives }0}}
            %
            + q(\vvec{v}_x\cross\vvec{B})\cdot\dd{\vvec{y}} 
            + q(\vvec{v}_y\cross\vvec{B})\cdot\dd{\vvec{x}}
            %
            + \cus[blue]{\ccancelto[blue]{0}{q(\vvec{v}_y\cross\vvec{B})\cdot\dd{\vvec{y}}}}
            {\substack{\vvec{v}_y\cross \vvec{B}= v_yB_z(\hhat{y}\cross \hhat{z})
                \\\phantom{\vvec{v}_{xi} \vvec{B}}=v_yB_z(\hhat{x})\\[0.5ex]
                \text{Dotting with }\hhat{y}\text{ gives }0}}\\[1ex]
        %
        &= \cus[red]{q(\vvec{v}_x\cross\vvec{B})\cdot\dd{\vvec{y}}}
                {\substack{\text{W.D. along }\hhat{y}\text{ direction}\\[0.5ex]\sim F_y \dd{y}}}
            +\cus[red]{q(\vvec{v}_y\cross\vvec{B})\cdot\dd{\vvec{x}}}
                {\substack{\text{W.D. along }\hhat{x}\text{ direction}\\[0.5ex]\sim F_x \dd{x}}}
    }

    Note that the W.D. along the two directions will always carry opposite sign.
    i.e. This is an energy conservation between the rod's KE in its travelling direction ($\hhat{x}$)
    and KE of charges along the rod ($\hhat{y}$).

    \insertFig{WD by B = 0}

    \item On the other hand, as charge accumulates at the ends of the rod,
    the charges will reach the equilibrium state when 
    Lorentz force of B-field is balanced by built-up potential from the charge accumulation. 
    The net forces, and thus W.D. to travel against the potential is:
    \addArrow[blue]{d_emf}{(0,-2ex)}{$\epsilon$ = EMF}{(0,-1ex)}{(2ex,-0.5ex)}
    \aleq{
        q\vvec{E} &= q\vvec{v}\cross\vvec{B}\\
        \Rightarrow\quad q\dd{\tkn{d_emf}{\cul[blue]{\epsilon}}} 
            \ \equiv\ q(\vvec{E}\cdot\dd{\hhat{y}})&= q(\vvec{v}\cross\vvec{B})\cdot\dd{\hhat{y}}   
    }
    

    i.e. The KE of charges along the rod ($\hhat{y}$) turns into energy stored in the built-up potential.

    \insertFig{free body diag}    
    
\end{enumerate}

That is, the phenomenon of motional EMF is no more than an energy conservation process from
the KE of a rod of charges to the potential built-up by its charges.

\subsubsection{Geometrical Relation with Flux}

Consider a wire with a changing shape in under a static B-field. 
Each segment $i$ of the wire is rod of length and orientation $\dd{l_i}$ and 
is moving in velocity $v_i$.
After some algebra, the emf generated in each segment can be re-written as 
\aleq{
        \dd{\epsilon} &= (\vvec{v}_i\cross\vvec{B})\cdot\dd{\vvec{l}_i}\\
        &= (\dd{\vvec{l}_i}\cross\vvec{v}_i)\cdot \vvec{B}\\
        &= -(\vvec{v}_i\cdot\dd{\vvec{l}_i})\cdot \vvec{B}
    }

Meanwhile, within a short duration $\dd{t}$,
the displacement of the segment is $\vvec{v}_i\dd{t}$.
Thus we can approximate the swept area by the segment as a parallelogram:
\aleq{
    \qty(\mstack{\text{Swept}\\\text{Area}})
    &= \qty(\mstack{\text{Area of parallelogram}\\\text{made by } v_i\dd{t} \text{ \& }\dd{l}_i})\\
    &\approx \norm{\vvec{v}_i}\norm{\dd{\vvec{l}_i}}\sin \qty(\mstack{\text{Angle between}\\\vvec{v}_i\dd{t} \text{ \& }\dd{l}_i})\\
    &= (\vvec{v}_i \dd{t})\cross(\dd{\vvec{l}_i})
    %
    \dvv{t} v_i\dd{t} \text{ \& }\dd{l}_i &= \vvec{v}_i\cross \dd{l}_i
} 

\insertFig{swept area}

We can now relate EMF generated in the whole wire with swept area by the wire as:
\aleq{
    \sum \epsilon = -\sum_{\substack{\text{All}\\\text{segments}}}
        \qty[(\vvec{v}_i\cross\dd{\vvec{l}_i})\cdot \vvec{B}]
    &= -\sum_{\substack{\text{All}\\\text{segments}}} 
        \qty[\dvv{t}\qty(\mstack{\text{Swept}\\\text{area}})_i\cdot \vvec{B}]\\
    &= -\dvv{t}\sum_{\substack{\text{All}\\\text{segments}}}
        \qty[\qty(\mstack{\text{Swept}\\\text{area}})\cdot \vvec{B}]
} 

When the segments are infinitestimally short, the sum becomes integral.
\aleq{
    \epsilon = -\int (\vvec{v}\cross\dd{\vvec{l}_i})\cdot\vvec{B}
    &= -\dvv{t}\qty[\iint_{\substack{\text{Swept}\\\text{area}}}\vvec{B}\cdot\dd{\vvec{s}}]\\
    &= -\dvv{t}\qty(\mstack{\text{Magnetic flux through}\\\text{the swept area}})
}

Pay attention to the depedendence to $t$ on the RHS:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The B-field $\vvec{B}$ is static. It is not a function of $t$.
    
    \item $\dd{\vvec{s}}$ is just a notation saying that this is a flux integral. 

    \item The only thing that depends on $t$ is the \cul[red]{integration range}.
\end{itemize}

So to be more accurate, the equation of motional EMF may be written as 
\aleq{
    \epsilon = - \int_{\substack{\text{along a wire}\\\text{of shape of }l(t)}} (\vvec{v}\cross\dd{\vvec{l}})\cdot \vvec{B}
    = -\dvv{t} \iint_{\substack{\text{Area }S(t)\\\text{swept by wire}}} \vvec{B}\cdot\dd{\vvec{s}}
}

to emphasize that it is the wire's shape / swept area varying with time.

\subsection{Transformer EMF}

The modern explanation to transformer EMF is by relativity - 
motional EMF and transformer EMF are the same phenomenon being observed in different reference frame. 

\insertFig{different ref frame}

EMF generated due to motion of the ring
EMF generated due to changing magnetic field strength

Consider a reference frame where the charge is static to the observer. 
Because the charge is not moving, 
Lorentz force by magnetic field $q\vvec{v}\cross\vvec{B}$ must be $0$.
But if a time-varying B-field is applied, 
experiments show that a transformer EMF will create, 
i.e. some mysterious forces appear on the charges, 
forcing them to form a potential difference.

How to explain this mysterious force? 
Add an induced E-field, and claim it to be generated by time-varying B-field.

\subsection{Maxwell-Faraday Equation}

\subsection{Lenz's Law}

The formula of Faraday's law, in particular the integral form,
can only be used to tell the magnitude of the induced EMF, 
but not its direction.
\aleq{
    \epsilon = -\dvv{t}\iint \vvec{B}\cdot\dd{\vvec{s}} 
}

This minus sign is not useful for determining the direction of EMF at all.

To determine the EMF's direction, we can apply \bf{Lenz's law},
which is in principle,
\begin{center}
    Induced EMF always want to "oppose" change in magnetic flux
\end{center}

And right hand grip rule is the only thing you need.
We can look at a few example to get familiar with it.

\begin{example}
    Consider a ring inside a magnetic field whose
    magnitude is increasing in the out-of-paper direction.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Magnetic flux is getting "more out-of-paper" due to 
        increase in B-field's magnitude.
        \item Induced EMF want to "oppose" this magnetic flux change.
        \item To oppose an increasing out-of-paper flux, one needs to decrease it,
        i.e. create an into-paper flux to compensate the increase.
        \item By right hand rule, into-paper flux can be created
        if a current flow clockwise in the ring. 
        So the induced EMF must be clockwise. 

    \end{enumerate}

    \insertFig{B field direction}
    \insertFig{induce flux direction}
    \insergFig{bar chart}
\end{example}



\begin{example}
    Consider a ring inside a constant into-paper B-field.
    The ring is shrinking in radius.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Magnetic flux is getting "less into-paper" due to
        decrease in area.
        \item Induced EMF want to "oppose" this magnetic flux change.
        \item To oppose a decreasing into-paper flux, one needs to increase it,
        i.e. create an into-paper flux to compensate the decrease.
        \item By right hand rule, into-paper flux can be created
        if a current flow clockwise in the ring.
        So the induced EMF must be clockwise.
        
    \end{enumerate}

\section{Basic Problems in Magnetic Induction}

Generally speaking, there are only two level of questions related to magnetic induction.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find EMF from change in area or change in B-field magnitude.
    This is a straightforward calculation to the surface integral of Faraday's law.
    \aleq{
        \epsilon = -\dvv{t}\iint \vvec{B}\cdot \dd{\vvec{s}} 
        \sim -\dvv{\vvec{B}(t)\cdot \qty(\text{Area})(t)}
    }
    Direction should be determined by Lenz's law, not this minus sign
    If B-field is given to be uniform, it reduces to a multiplication.

    Even at university level questions, 
    it is rare to give a situation where both area and B-field are changing. 
    Usually one of them is fixed and the rate of change of the other will be given.
    \aleq{
        \epsilon = -\vvec{B} \cdot \dvv{t}(\text{Area}) 
        \qquad\text{or}\qquad
        \epsilon = -\dvv{t}\vvec{B} \cdot (\text{Area})
    }

    \item Find the induced E-field from the change in B-field. 
    This is in fact the task of solving the PDE of Maxwell-Faraday equation.
    \aleq{
        \curl \vvec{E} = -\pdvv{\vvec{B}}{t}
    }



\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Finding EMF}

\subsection{Finding induced E-field}

Similar to how we deal with Gauss's law or Ampere's law,
we can avoid solving PDF in some very symmetrical cases.
If these conditions are satisfied:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item E-field is of the same magnitude everywhere on the loop.
    \item E-field make the same angle with each line segment of the loop.
\end{enumerate}

We can reduce the integral form of Maxwell-Faraday equation in to multiplication.
\aleq{
    -\dvv{t}\iint\vvec{B}\cdot\dd{\vec{s}} &= \oint \vvec{E}\cdot\dd{\vvec{l}}
    &\sim \norm{\vvec{E}}\cos\theta \qty(\text{loop's perimeter})\\
    \norm{\vvec{E}} &= \frac{\qty(\text{Flux of }\vvec{B})}{\cos\theta (\text{loop's perimeter})}
}

\begin{example}
    Consider a static rectangular loop next to an infinitely long wire, 
    which carries a time-varying current $I(t)$. 

    \insertFig{loop next to wire}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Find the magnetic flux through the loop.
        By Ampere's law, the B-field due to an infinitely long wire is 
        \aleq{
            \vvec{B}(t) = \frac{\mu_0}{2\pi}\frac{I(t)}{r}
        }
        
        The magnetic flux through the loop can be calculated by 
        first dividing the loop's area into strips,
        then integrate the flux of all strips.
        \aleq{
            \Phi_B &= \iint \vvec{B}\cdot\dd{\vvec{s}}\\
            &= \int_{r_1}^{r_2} \frac{\mu_0 I(t)}{2\pi r} (L\dd{r})\\
            &= \frac{\mu_0 I(t) L}{2\pi}\qty[\ln(r_2)-\ln(r_1)]
        }

        \insertFig{split into strips}

        \item The total EMF generated in the loop can be computed just be differentiating the above. i.e.
        \aleq{
            \epsilon = \frac{\mu_0 L}{2\pi}\qty(\dvv{I(t)}{t})[\ln(r_2) - \ln(r_1)]
        }

        Depends on how the current varies, 
        we can use Lenz's law to determine the direction of the EMF.
        For example, if $I(t)$ is increasing, magnetic flux wil be increasing in the upward direction.
        So to oppose the change, EMF must be in clockwise direction (when look from above) 
        to produce a downward direction flux.

        \item But for the E-field, all we know is 
        \aleq{
            \abs{\epsilon} = \oint \vvec{E}\cdot \dd{\vvec{l}} 
            = E^\sparallel_1L + E^\sparallel_2(r_2-r_1) + E^\sparallel_3 L + E^\sparallel_4 (r_2-r_1)
        }

        \insertFig{show label of edge only parallel}
        
        After taking dot product, only the component parallel to the edge is left.\\

        To find each $E$, we need to apply symmetry arguments.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item By rotation symmetry, 
            the E-field is only a function of radial distance from the wire. 
            We can claim that $E^\sparallel_1$ and $E^\sparallel_3$ must have the same function form $\vvec{E}(r)$,
            
            \insertFig{rotation sym}
            
            \item By translational symmetry, 
            $E_2$ and $E_4$ must be the same. 
            Their contributions of dot product along the loop are cancelled.
        \end{itemize}
        
        So the E-field relation to EMF is reduced to
        \aleq{
            \abs{epsilon} = E^\sparallel_3 L - E^\sparallel_1 L
            = E^\sparallel(r_2) L - E^\sparallel(r_1) L = 
            = \frac{\mu_0 L}{2\pi}\qty(\dvv{I(t)}{t}) \qty[\ln(r_2)-\ln(r_1)]
        }
        
        and we can claim that the component of $\vvec{E}$ \cul[red]{parallel to the wire} is
        \aleq{
            E^\sparallel(r) = \frac{\mu_0 L}{2\pi}\qty(\dvv{I(t)}{t})\ln(r)
        }

        \item Note that in the above analysis
        we cannot determine if the E-field has components perpendicular to the wire.

        \insertFig{parallel + perpendicular}

        It is totally possible for the E-field to carry a non-zero component perpendicular to the wire -
        by Gauss's law, 
        E-field is perpendicular to the wire if the wire carries a \cul[red]{static} line charge density.
        So if the wire carries BOTH net charge and time-varying current,
        the total E-field will be in diagonal directions.

        \insertFig{sum of horizontal + vertical contribution = diagonal}

    \end{enumerate}
